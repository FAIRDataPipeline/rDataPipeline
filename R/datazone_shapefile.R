#' #' Data Zone Boundaries 2011
#' #'
#' #' Data zones are the key geography for the dissemination of small area
#' #' statistics in Scotland and are widely used across the public and private
#' #' sector. Composed of aggregates of Census Output Areas, data zones are large
#' #' enough that statistics can be presented accurately without fear of
#' #' disclosure and yet small enough that they can be used to represent
#' #' communities. They are designed to have roughly standard populations of
#' #' 500 to 1,000 household residents, nest within Local Authorities, have
#' #' compact shapes that respect physical boundaries where possible, and to
#' #' contain households with similar social characteristics. Aggregations of
#' #' data zones are often used to approximate a larger area of interest or a
#' #' higher level geography that statistics wouldnâ€™t normally be available for.
#' #' Data zones also represent a relatively stable geography that can be used
#' #' to analyse change over time, with changes only occurring after a Census.
#' #' Following the update to data zones using 2011 Census data, there are now
#' #' 6,976 data zones covering the whole of Scotland.
